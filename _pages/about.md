I am interested in developing structure-exploiting algorithms for the learning and control of dynamical systems.
My research has mainly focused on improving **safety in reinforcement learning using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and Control Barrier Functions**, with applications to multi-agent systems and fixed wing aircraft.
I have also dabbled in topics such as **scientific reasoning in (d)LLMs**.

<!-- I'm Oswin So, a 4th year PhD student in <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/realm">REALM</a> at MIT, -->

I'm currently at <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/realm">REALM</a> at MIT, advised by <a href="https://chuchu.mit.edu/">Chuchu Fan</a>.
Previously, I did my undergrad at Georgia Tech, where I was very fortunate to do
undergraduate research with
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG9MV7oAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Evangelos Theodorou</a>
and
<a href="https://mtao8.math.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Molei Tao</a>.

The past summer, I interned at META FAIR working on fine-tuning discrete generative models characterized by Continuous-Time Markov Chains (e.g., diffusion-based LLMs), where I was mentored by <a href="https://ghliu.github.io" target="_blank">Guan-Horng Liu</a> and worked with <a href="https://rtqichen.github.io">Ricky T. Q. Chen</a>.
I've previously interned at Toyota Research Institute, where I worked on game theoretic planning.
I also worked at Aurora as a Behavior Planning Intern during the summer of 2021 under
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=daYjNkAAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Paul Vernaza</a>
and
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nt4rO1EAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Arun Venkatraman</a>,
working on cost function learning via on-policy negative examples for autonomous driving.
