  abstract = {Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and complete a team goal while maintaining safety. This problem is usually formalized as a Constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a user-defined threshold. Inspired by real-world robotic applications, we define safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to solve CMDPs, these algorithms suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed execution MARL algorithm which we name Def-MARL. Simulation experiments on 8 different tasks across 2 different simulators show that Def-MARL achieves the best overall performance, satisfies safety constraints, and maintains stable training. Real-world hardware experiments on Crazyflie quadcopters demonstrate the ability of Def-MARL to safely coordinate agents to complete complex collaborative tasks compared to other methods.},

  booktitle={Robotics: Science and Systems},
  abstract = {A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this, we make a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to black-box dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency and enabling real-time planning on CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments.},

  abstract={Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety contraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose DGPPO, a new framework that simultaneously learns both a discrete graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a constant set of hyperparameters across all environments.},

  abstract={Distributed, scalable, and safe control of large-scale multi-agent systems (MAS) is a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a distributed framework for safe multi-agent control in large-scale environments with obstacles, where a large number of agents are required to maintain safety using only local information and reach their goal locations. We introduce a new class of certificates, termed graph control barrier function (GCBF), which are based on the well-established control barrier function (CBF) theory for safety guarantees and utilize a graph structure for scalable and generalizable distributed control of MAS. We develop a novel theoretical framework to prove the safety of an arbitrary-sized MAS with a single GCBF. We propose a new training framework GCBF+ that uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to parameterize a candidate GCBF and a distributed control policy. The proposed framework is distributed and is capable of directly taking point clouds from LiDAR, instead of actual state information, for real-world robotic applications. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method through various hardware experiments on a swarm of drones with objectives ranging from exchanging positions to docking on a moving target without collision. Additionally, we perform extensive numerical experiments, where the number and density of agents, as well as the number of obstacles, increase. Empirical results show that in complex environments with nonlinear agents (e.g., Crazyflie drones) GCBF+ outperforms the handcrafted CBF-based method with the best performance by up to 20% for relatively small-scale MAS for up to 256 agents, and leading reinforcement learning (RL) methods by up to 40% for MAS with 1024 agents. Furthermore, the proposed method does not compromise on the performance, in terms of goal reaching, for achieving high safety rates, which is a common trade-off in RL-based methods.},

  abstract={Current reinforcement-learning methods are unable to directly learn policies that solve the minimum cost reach-avoid problem to minimize cumulative costs subject to the constraints of reaching the goal and avoiding unsafe states, as the structure of this new optimization problem is incompatible with current methods. Instead, a surrogate problem is solved where all objectives are combined with a weighted sum. However, this surrogate objective results in suboptimal policies that do not directly minimize the cumulative cost. In this work, we propose RC-PPO, a reinforcement-learning-based method for solving the minimum-cost reach-avoid problem by using connections to Hamilton-Jacobi reachability. Empirical results demonstrate that RC-PPO learns policies with comparable goal-reaching rates to while achieving up to 57% lower cumulative costs compared to existing methods on a suite of minimum-cost reach-avoid benchmarks on the Mujoco simulator.},

We start with various types of shielding-based methods, such as safety certificates, predictive filters, and reachability tools. Then, we review the current state of control barrier certificate learning in both a centralized and distributed manner, followed by a comprehensive review of multi-agent reinforcement learning with a particular focus on safety. Next, we discuss the state-of-the-art verification tools for the correctness of learning-based methods. Based on the capabilities and the limitations of the state of the art methods in learning and verification for MAS, we identify various broad themes for open challenges: how to design methods that can achieve good performance along with safety guarantees; how to decompose single-agent based centralized methods for MAS; how to account for communication-related practical issues; and how to assess transfer of theoretical guarantees to practice.},

    abstract={Control barrier functions (CBF) have become popular as a safety filter to guarantee the safety of nonlinear dynamical systems for arbitrary inputs. However, it is difficult to construct functions that satisfy the CBF constraints for high relative degree systems with input constraints. To address these challenges, recent work has explored learning CBFs using neural networks via neural CBF (NCBF). However, such methods face difficulties when scaling to higher dimensional systems under input constraints. In this work, we first identify challenges that NCBFs face during training. Next, to address these challenges, we propose policy neural CBF (PNCBF), a method of constructing CBFs by learning the value function of a nominal policy, and show that the value function of the maximum-over-time cost is a CBF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simulation on a variety of systems ranging from toy linear systems to an F-16 jet with a 16-dimensional state space. Finally, we validate our approach on a two-agent quadcopter system on hardware under tight input constraints.},

  abstract = {Tasks for autonomous robotic systems commonly require stabilization to a desired region while maintaining safety specifications. However, solving this multi-objective problem is challenging when the dynamics are nonlinear and high-dimensional, as traditional methods do not scale well and are often limited to specific problem structures. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to solve the stabilize-avoid problem via the solution of an infinite-horizon constrained optimal control problem (OCP). We transform the constrained OCP into epigraph form and obtain a two-stage optimization problem that optimizes over the policy in the inner problem and over an auxiliary variable in the outer problem. We then propose a new method for this formulation that combines an on-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm with neural network regression. Our method yields better stability during training, avoids instabilities caused by saddle-point finding, and is not restricted to specific requirements on the problem structure compared to more traditional methods. We validate our approach on different benchmark tasks, ranging from low-dimensional toy examples to an F16 fighter jet with a 17-dimensional state space. Simulation results show that our approach consistently yields controllers that match or exceed the safety of existing methods while providing ten-fold increases in stability performance from larger regions of attraction.},

By reformulating the problem as a POMDP, we propose MPOGames, a method for efficiently solving MaxEnt dynamic games that captures the interactions between local Nash equilibria. We show the importance of uncertainty-aware game theoretic methods via a two-agent merge case study. Finally, we prove the real-time capabilities of our approach with hardware experiments on a 1/10th scale car platform.},

    abstract = {Mean-Field Game (MFG) serves as a crucial mathematical framework in modeling the collective behavior of individual agents interacting stochastically with a large population. In this work, we aim at solving a challenging class of MFGs in which the differentiability of these interacting preferences may not be available to the solver, and the population is urged to converge exactly to some desired distribution. These setups are, despite being well-motivated for practical purposes, complicated enough to paralyze most (deep) numerical solvers. Nevertheless, we show that Schr\"odinger Bridge - as an entropy-regularized optimal transport model - can be generalized to accepting mean-field structures, hence solving these MFGs. This is achieved via the application of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations theory, which, intriguingly, leads to a computational framework with a similar structure to Temporal Difference learning. As such, it opens up novel algorithmic connections to Deep Reinforcement Learning that we leverage to facilitate practical training. We show that our proposed objective function provides necessary and sufficient conditions to the mean-field problem. Our method, named Deep Generalized Schr\"odinger Bridge (DeepGSB), not only outperforms prior methods in solving classical population navigation MFGs, but is also capable of solving 1000-dimensional opinion depolarization, setting a new state-of-the-art numerical solver for high-dimensional MFGs.

In this paper, we propose MMELQGames (Multimodal Maximum-Entropy Linear Quadratic Games), a novel constrained multimodal maximum entropy formulation of the Differential Dynamic Programming algorithm for solving generalized Nash equilibria. By formulating the problem as a certain dynamic game with incomplete and asymmetric information where agents are uncertain about the cost and dynamics of the game itself, the proposed method is able to reason about multiple local generalized Nash equilibria, enforce constraints with the Augmented Lagrangian framework and also perform Bayesian inference on the latent mode from past observations. We assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on two illustrative examples: multi-agent collision avoidance and autonomous racing. In particular, we show that only MMELQGames is able to effectively block a rear vehicle when given a speed disadvantage and the rear vehicle can overtake from multiple positions.},

Safety is mathematically encoded using stochastic control barrier functions and safe controls are computed by solving quadratic programs. Decentralization is achieved by augmenting to each agent’s optimization variables, copy variables, for its neighboring agents. This allows us to decouple the centralized multi-agent optimization problem. How- ever, to ensure safety, neighboring agents must agree on what is safe for both of us and this creates a need for consensus. To enable safe consensus solutions, we incorporate an ADMM- based approach. Specifically, we propose a Merged CADMM- OSQP implicit neural network layer, that solves a mini-batch of both, local quadratic programs as well as the overall con- sensus problem, as a single optimization problem. This layer is embedded within a Deep FBSDEs network architecture at every time step, to facilitate end-to-end differentiable, safe and decentralized stochastic optimal control. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on several challenging multi- robot tasks in simulation. By imposing requirements on safety specified by collision avoidance constraints, the safe operation of all agents is ensured during the entire training process.
