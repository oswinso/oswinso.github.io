  abstract={In this paper, we present a novel maximum entropy formulation of the Differential Dynamic Programming algorithm and derive two variants using unimodal and multimodal value functions parameterizations. By combining the maximum entropy Bellman equations with a particular approximation of the cost function, we are able to obtain a new formulation of Differential Dynamic Programming which is able to escape from local minima via exploration with a multimodal policy. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we provide experimental results using four systems on tasks that are represented by cost functions with multiple local minima and compare them against vanilla Differential Dynamic Programming. Furthermore, we discuss connections with previous work on the linearly solvable stochastic control framework and its extensions in relation to compositionality.},

  abstract={In this paper, we provide a generalized framework for Variational Inference-Stochastic Optimal Control by using thenon-extensive Tsallis divergence. By incorporating the deformed exponential function into the optimality likelihood function, a novel Tsallis Variational Inference-Model Predictive Control algorithm is derived, which includes prior works such as Variational Inference-Model Predictive Control, Model Predictive PathIntegral Control, Cross Entropy Method, and Stein VariationalInference Model Predictive Control as special cases. The proposed algorithm allows for effective control of the cost/reward transform and is characterized by superior performance in terms of mean and variance reduction of the associated cost. The aforementioned features are supported by a theoretical and numerical analysis on the level of risk sensitivity of the proposed algorithm as well as simulation experiments on 5 different robotic systems with 3 different policy parameterizations.},

  abstract={We consider the optimal control problem of a general nonlinear spatio-temporal system described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Theory and algorithms for control of spatio-temporal systems are of rising interest among the automatic control community and exhibit numerous challenging characteristic from a control standpoint. Recent methods focus on finite-dimensional optimization techniques of a discretized finite dimensional ODE approximation of the infinite dimensional PDE system. In this paper, we derive a differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework for distributed and boundary control of spatio-temporal systems in infinite dimensions that is shown to generalize both the spatio-temporal LQR solution, and modern finite dimensional DDP frameworks. We analyze the convergence behavior and provide a proof of global convergence for the resulting system of continuous-time forward-backward equations. We explore and develop numerical approaches to handle sensitivities that arise during implementation, and apply the resulting STDDP algorithm to a linear and nonlinear spatio-temporal PDE system. Our framework is derived in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, and represents a discretization-agnostic framework for control of nonlinear spatio-temporal PDE systems.},

  abstract={We present a general framework for optimizing the Conditional Value-at-Risk for dynamical systems using stochastic search. The framework is capable of handling the uncertainty from the initial condition, stochastic dynamics, and uncertain parameters in the model. The algorithm is compared against a risk-sensitive distributional reinforcement learning framework and demonstrates outperformance on a pendulum and cartpole with stochastic dynamics. We also showcase the applicability of the framework to robotics as an adaptive risk-sensitive controller by optimizing with respect to the fully nonlinear belief provided by a particle filter on a pendulum, cartpole, and quadcopter in simulation.},
