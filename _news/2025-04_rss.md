Happy to announce that my papers on <strong>constructing safe distributed controllers by combining epigraph form with multi-agent reinforcement learning</strong> and <strong>improving constraint satisfaction of sampling-based MPC (such as MPPI / CEM) with neural CBFs and better sampling techniques</strong>
has been accepted to **RSS 2025**! Stay tuned for the project page for both papers.
