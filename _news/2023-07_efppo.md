My first paper after joining MIT as a grad student on <strong>[combining Deep RL and optimal control to synthesize safe, stabilizing controllers](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p085.html)</strong>
    has been accepted to **RSS 2023**! Check out the [project page for cool visualizations and videos](https://mit-realm.github.io/efppo).
