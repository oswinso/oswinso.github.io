<strong>[Decentralized Safe Multi-agent Stochastic Optimal Control using Deep FBSDEs and ADMM](assets/publications/Pereira_et_al_Decentralized_Safe_Multi-agent_Stochastic_Optimal_Control_using_Deep_FBSDEs.pdf)</strong>
were recently submitted to **RSS 2022** and are currently under review! Check them out.
